# Machine Madness!

DISCLAIMER:
Lines 17-22 in "calculator.py" is not my own work. It's the code that checks whether the input that you put in is a number or not, and without it the file would crash.
It has nothing to do with the algorithm, but just in case I'm gonna make that clear.

INFO:
It can detect what operation you used & is more likely to pick one operation the more times you use it, but only in certain cases. It is very amateurish, & I may or may not update it.

FAQ
Q. How do I know this isn't a virus?
A. Open either file with a text editor (like Notepad) & you'll see that none of the commands have anything to do with hacking your computer or something.

Q. What does the version number mean?
A. If the first number changes, then there was a major update to the algorithm (or calculator, but that's not likely).
If the second number changes, then there was a quality of life change (automatic algorithm that just gives you the results, random number generator for the numbers themselves, etc.)
If the third number changes, there was a bugfix.
If the fourth number changes, there was just a code optimization.
In the off-chance that there's a fifth number, there was probably just an update to this file, but there most likely wouldn't be one.

Q. You can only submit the version that was completed before science fair was finished, so which version should I pick?
A. Any version with 1.x.x(.x), because the last two (or three) numbers were only bug fixes, so it shouldn't affect any data.
However, if you want to include bugs when trying this out for yourself, then 1.0.1 would be the one to use.

Q. Where's 1.0.0(.0)?
A. That was sent privately to people to test for themselves, & I don't want them to get these two versions mixed up. Just pretend that it doesn't exist, because it pretty much doesn't.

Q. Why do you keep including the fourth number in parentheses?
A. Because it might not always be there, in which you should assume that that number is zero. Three numbers are enough anyways.
Also, I'm not gonna include the aforementioned fifth number in anything unless present.

Q. How do I run it?
A. Run "start.bat."

Q. Will this work on Mac?
A. No, I'm pretty sure .bat files will only work on Windows, so you might have to look up how to convert it or something.

Q. Why did you make the file that I have to run a .bat file instead of a .exe file?
A. I know how to convert it, but I don't know how you would check for viruses that way due to the fact that there are more files that would be present, & they're unfamiliar to me.

Q. Why is this file so informal?
A. Because I don't think the rules of science fair say anything about digital files needing to be formal, but I might be wrong.

Q. How do I know this was your work?
A. It's pretty amature, but if you want concrete evidence you can call me over and ask me to explain the code to you, because I could.

Q. How can I contact you?
A. I have a personal email address, but I don't really check it that much.
I'll try to be active on my school one (5620702472@stlucieschools.org), but if you really wanna contact me fast, you should message me over Discord (Kombats12345#2700). Expect me to answer within a few minutes to a few days outside of school hours.

Q. Why didn't you format this file better?
A. You can't format a .txt file much better than this (or at least, with Notepad).

Q. Why is this a .txt file?
A. I'm pretty sure all files I've found online (which is a lot) with "readme"'s are .txt files, & I didn't want to break the tradition.

Q. Why are there typos in this (if there are any)?
A. Because Notepad doesn't have AutoCorrect.

Q. Why doesn't it work, even on Windows?
A. I'm not sure, but try installing the latest version of Python 3 (https://www.python.org/) and trying again. If it still doesn't work, then try looking it up.

Q. Why was this in a .zip file?
A. For the same reason this is a .txt file, & also because it takes up less space.

VERSION HISTORY
v1.0.0(.0) (previously known as v1)
The first "release".
Had some bugs that were fixed in the next release.
Very crude & only includes one operation.
I was working on the next version, which had multiple types of algorithms (like brute-force, etc.), infinite operations, etc., but I didn't finish in time due to procrastinating.
Only sent out to a few people.

v1.0.1(.0)
Major bugfixes and minor optimizations.
The final release before science fair is due.
