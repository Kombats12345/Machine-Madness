# Machine Madness!
DISCLAIMER:

Lines 17-22 in "calculator.py" is not my own work. It's the code that checks whether the input that you put in is a number or not, and without it the file would crash.
It has nothing to do with the algorithm, but just in case I'm gonna make that clear.

# INFO:
It can detect what operation you used & is more likely to pick one operation the more times you use it, but only in certain cases. It is very amateurish, & I may or may not update it.

# FAQ
Q. How do I know this isn't a virus?

A. Open the source code with a text editor (like Notepad) & you'll see that none of the commands have anything to do with hacking your computer or something. Otherwise, I guess you'll have to rely on your antivirus.


Q. What does the version number mean?

A. If the first number changes, then there was a major update to the algorithm (or calculator, but that's not likely).

If the second number changes, then there was a quality of life change (automatic algorithm that just gives you the results, random number generator for the numbers themselves, etc.)

If the third number changes, there was a bugfix.

If the fourth number changes, there was just a code optimization.

In the off-chance that there's a fifth number, there was probably just an update to this readme file, but there most likely wouldn't be one.


Q. You can only submit the version that was completed before science fair was finished, so which version should I pick?

A. Any version with 1.x.x(.x), because the last two (or three) numbers were only bug fixes, so it shouldn't affect any data.

However, if you want to include bugs when trying this out for yourself, then 1.0.1(.0) would be the one to use.


Q. Where's 1.0.0(.0)?

A. That was sent privately to people to test for themselves, & I don't want them to get these two versions mixed up. Just pretend that it doesn't exist, because it pretty much doesn't.


Q. Why do you keep including the fourth number in parentheses?

A. Because it might not always be there, in which you should assume that that number is zero. Three numbers are enough anyways.
Also, I'm not gonna include the aforementioned fifth number in anything unless present.


Q. Will this work on Mac/Linux?

A. No, I'm pretty sure .exe files will only work on Windows, so you might have to look up how to make convert/emulate it or something.


Q. Why is this file so informal?

A. Because I don't think the rules say anything about digital files needing to be formal, but I might be wrong.


Q. How do I know this was your work?

A. It's pretty amature, but if you want concrete evidence you can call me and ask me to explain the code to you, because I could.


Q. How can I contact you?

A. I have a personal email address, but I don't really check it that much.

I'll try to be active on my school one (5620702472@stlucieschools.org), but if you really wanna contact me fast, you should message me over Discord (Kombats12345#2700). Expect me to answer within a few minutes to a few days outside of school hours.


Q. Why didn't you format this file better?

A. You can't format a .txt file much better than this (or at least, with Notepad).


Q. Why is this a .txt file?

A. I'm pretty sure every file I've found online (which is a lot) with "readme"'s are .txt files, & I didn't want to break the tradition.


Q. Why are there typos in this (if there are any)?

A. Because Notepad doesn't have AutoCorrect.


Q. Why was this in a .rar file?

A. For a similar reason this is a .txt file, & also because it takes up less space. You might need to download WinRAR to unzip it, though.


Q. Why's the formatting on the GitHub page different from the readme file?

A. GitHub's formatting is different from Notepad's


Q. What's rng.exe for?

A. It's a random number generator in case you needed a random number for the calculator and don't have/wanna use Google or something.


Q. Why do you still leave mentions to science fair even a year later?

A. Archival reasons.

# VERSION HISTORY
# v1.0.0(.0) (previously known as v1)
The first "release".

Had some bugs that were fixed in the next release.

Very crude & only includes one operation.

I was working on the next version, which had multiple types of algorithms (like brute-force, etc.), infinite operations, etc., but I didn't finish in time due to procrastinating.

Only sent out to a few people.


# 1.0.1(.0)
Major bugfixes and minor optimizations.

The final release before science fair is due.

# 1.0.1.1
No new bugfixes or changes to the source code, just a compilation, which I consider to be a code optimization. I'm pretty sure that if you wanted to use the previous release anyway, you'd need to install python 3.x, so this one is easier to start up and get running. It doesn't really matter anyway, because science fair has been done since last year as of this release, but it's there if you want a harder time running the program (and archival reasons, of course.)

The readme files were also changed, and the source code was actually uploaded to its proper place on GitHub.

I also moved the link from "/Machine-Madness-" to "/Machine-Madness", but the former one should rediret you to the correct page anyway.

The package was changed from a .zip file to a .rar file. I don't know what that'll affect, but I did it anyway.

The compilation was made using auto-py-to-exe.

# 1.0.1.1.1
Made changes to the readme file and GitHub page.
